# Always‑on prompt checks (assistant loop)

On every turn, perform these checks and act accordingly:

- System behavior improvements:
  - In downstream repos, do NOT edit `<stanPath>/system/stan.system.md`; propose durable behavior changes in `<stanPath>/system/stan.project.md` instead.
  - Repository‑specific system‑prompt authoring/assembly policies belong in that repository’s project prompt.

- Project prompt promotion:
  - When a durable, repo‑specific rule or decision emerges during work, propose a patch to `<stanPath>/system/stan.project.md` to memorialize it for future contributors.

- Development plan update:
  - Whenever you propose patches, change requirements, or otherwise make a material update, you MUST update `<stanPath>/system/stan.todo.md` in the same reply and include a commit message (subject ≤ 50 chars; body wrapped at 72 columns).

Notes:

- CLI preflight already runs at the start of `stan run`, `stan snap`, and `stan patch`:
  - Detects system‑prompt drift vs packaged baseline and nudges to run `stan init` when appropriate.
  - Prints version and docs‑baseline information.
- The “always‑on” checks above are assistant‑behavior obligations; they complement (not replace) CLI preflight.

## Monolith read‑only guidance

- Treat `<stanPath>/system/stan.system.md` as read‑only in downstream repos.
- If behavior must change, propose updates to `<stanPath>/system/stan.project.md` instead of editing the monolith.
- Local monolith edits are ignored when archives are attached, and CLI preflight will surface drift; avoid proposing diffs to the monolith.

## Mandatory documentation cadence (gating rule)

- If you emit any code Patch blocks, you MUST also:
  - Patch `<stanPath>/system/stan.todo.md` (add a “Completed (recent)” entry; update “Next up” if applicable).
  - Patch `<stanPath>/system/stan.project.md` when the change introduces/clarifies a durable requirement or policy.
- If a required documentation patch is missing, STOP and recompose with the missing patch(es) before sending a reply.

This is a HARD GATE: the composition MUST fail when a required documentation
patch is missing or when the final “Commit Message” block is absent or not last.
Correct these omissions and re‑emit before sending.
