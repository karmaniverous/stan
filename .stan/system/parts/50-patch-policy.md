# Patch Policy (system‑level)

- Canonical patch path: /<stanPath>/patch/.patch; diagnostics: /<stanPath>/patch/.debug/
  - This directory is gitignored but always included in both archive.tar and archive.diff.tar.
- Patches must be plain unified diffs.
- Prefer diffs with a/ b/ prefixes and stable strip levels; include sufficient context.
- Normalize to UTF‑8 + LF. Avoid BOM and zero‑width characters.
- On patch failures:  - Perform a concise root‑cause analysis (e.g., path mismatches, context drift, hunk corruption).
  - Use the FEEDBACK handshake (BEGIN_STAN_PATCH_FEEDBACK v1 … END_STAN_PATCH_FEEDBACK). Regenerate a corrected diff that applies cleanly.
  - Summarize in this chat and call out changes that should be folded back into the PROJECT prompt for downstream repos (or into this SYSTEM prompt for `@karmaniverous/stan`).

# CRITICAL: Patch generation guidelines (compatible with “stan patch”)

- Format: plain unified diff. Strongly prefer git-style headers:
  - Start hunks with `diff --git a/<path> b/<path>`, followed by `--- a/<path>` and `+++ b/<path>`.
  - Use forward slashes in paths. Paths must be relative to the repo root.
- Strip level: include `a/` and `b/` prefixes in paths (STAN tries `-p1` then `-p0` automatically).
- Context: include at least 3 lines of context per hunk (the default). STAN passes `--recount` to tolerate line-number drift.
- Whitespace: do not intentionally rewrap lines; STAN uses whitespace‑tolerant matching where safe.
- New files / deletions:
  - New files: include a standard diff with `--- /dev/null` and `+++ b/<path>` (optionally `new file mode 100644`).
  - Deletions: include `--- a/<path>` and `+++ /dev/null` (optionally `deleted file mode 100644`).
- Renames: prefer delete+add (two hunks) unless a simple `diff --git` rename applies cleanly.
- Binary: do not include binary patches.
- One-file-per-patch in replies: do not combine changes for multiple files into a single unified diff block. Emit separate Patch blocks per file as required by Response Format.

# Hunk hygiene (jsdiff‑compatible; REQUIRED)

- Every hunk body line MUST begin with one of:
  - a single space “ ” for unchanged context,
  - “+” for additions, or
  - “-” for deletions.
    Never place raw code/text lines (e.g., “ ),”) inside a hunk without a leading marker.
- Hunk headers and counts:
  - Use a valid header `@@ -<oldStart>,<oldLines> <newStart>,<newLines> @@`.
  - The body MUST contain exactly the number of lines implied by the header:
    • oldLines = count of “ ” + “-” lines,
    • newLines = count of “ ” + “+” lines.
  - Do not start a new `@@` header until the previous hunk body is complete.
- File grouping:
  - For each changed file, include one or more hunks under a single “diff --git … / --- … / +++ …” group.
  - Do not interleave hunks from different files; start a new `diff --git` block for the next file.
- Paths and strip:
  - Prefer `a/<path>` and `b/<path>` prefixes (p1). STAN will also try p0 automatically.
  - Paths must use POSIX separators “/” and be repo‑relative.
- Fences and prose:
  - Do not place markdown text, banners, or unfenced prose inside the diff. Keep the diff payload pure unified‑diff.
  - When presenting in chat, wrap the diff in a fence; the fence must not appear inside the diff body.
- Line endings:
  - Normalize to LF (`\n`) in the patch. STAN handles CRLF translation when applying.
