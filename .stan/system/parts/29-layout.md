# CRITICAL: Layout

- stanPath (default: `.stan`) is the root for STAN operational assets:
  - `/<stanPath>/system`: policies (this file). The project prompt (`stan.project.md`) is created on demand by STAN when repo‑specific requirements emerge (no template is installed or shipped).
  - `/<stanPath>/output`: script outputs and `archive.tar`/`archive.diff.tar`
  - /<stanPath>/diff: diff snapshot state (`.archive.snapshot.json`, `archive.prev.tar`, `.stan_no_changes`)
  - `/<stanPath>/dist`: dev build (e.g., for npm script `stan:build`)
  - `/<stanPath>/patch`: canonical patch workspace (see Patch Policy)
- Config key is `stanPath`.
- Bootloader note: A minimal bootloader may be present at `/<stanPath>/system/stan.bootloader.md` to help assistants locate `stan.system.md` in attached artifacts; once `stan.system.md` is loaded, the bootloader has no further role.
